# naughts-and-crosses
Created with CodeSandbox


This repo is functioning game for multiple players over the internets.

We paused development in our stream so that others could contribute and build their skills.

Here are some ideas:

- [ ] Make it show noughts and crosses instead of n and c...
- [ ] Celebrate the winner, maybe with the ballons?
- [ ] game chat while playing
- [ ] global chat while not playing
- [ ] have user login and lock db to the url
- [ ] send invite (url)
- [ ] friend list
- [ ] share on facebook
- [ ] make it look cooler? must keep brand colors though... rebeccapurple, hotpink, aqua, ect
- [ ] ranking
- [ ] play ai lulz cuz its random
- [ ] smarter defense ai
- [ ] smarter ai :P
- [ ] leader board
- [ ] user name
- [ ] private match

To start on an idea simply make an issue for it if it does not exist. There will be a link next to it if it exists.
The issue will house the converstion on the feature/idea.

Feel free to contribute other ideas.
